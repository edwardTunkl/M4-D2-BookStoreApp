    <h2>Improve your Bookstore!</h2>

    <h4>
      Start from your previous React book store. We want you to give the user the ability to add comments to the books.
      All the comments will be visible to everyone :)
    </h4>

    <pre>
      <code>
        API INFO:

        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:

        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/

        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.

        !IMPORTANT!
        use your usual Authentication headers (grab a new token on https://strive.school/studentlogin if you're previous one is expired)


        A comment object is structured in this way:

        {
          "comment": string
          "rate": string,
          "elementId": string
        }

        Where:
        - "comment" is the text of comment inserted by the user
        - "rate" is a value between 1 and 5
        - "elementId" is the ASIN of the book

        Example:
        {
          "comment": "A good book but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": "3",
          "elementId": "0316438960"
        }

        !IMPORTANT!
        Doing a GET on https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/ will give you ALL the comments in the database.
        Probably what you're most interested in is getting the comments of a single book at a time: for doing so
        you'll have to specify the elementId/ASIN of the book in your url, like https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/:elementId

        Example:
        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/0316438960

        In this way you'll get all the comments for that specific book.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add a CommentArea component at the end of your SingleBook. When the user clicks on a SingleBook, this component
        should appear (hint: short-circuit!).
      </li>
      <li>
        CommentArea should fetch and store the comments for the selected book, and contains two subcomponents:
        CommentsList and AddComment.
      </li>
      <li>
        CommentsList holds a list of comments about the selected book, the comments array is passed as a prop from
        CommentArea. Each comment is made by the same SingleComment component.
      </li>
      <li>
        AddComment contains a form for adding a text comment and a rating (from 1 to 5). This component should allow the
        user to POST a new comment on the selected book.
      </li>
      <h3>EXTRA:</h3>
      <li>
        Add near to each comment a button for DELETING it. It should create a request towards
        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/:commentId
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Loading component. This loading component should appear on the page when a remote request is ongoing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an Error component. If something goes wrong with a network request, an error message should appear!
      </li>
